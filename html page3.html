<h2>What are Disantages of artificial intelligence <h2>
<h3>1. HIGH COST OF IMPLEMENTATION<h3>
<h4>Setting up AI-based machines, computers,
 etc. entails huge costs given the complexity of engineering that goes into building one.
  Further, the astronomical expense doesn’t stop there as repair and maintenance
   also run into thousands of dollars. Do you know how much it cost Apple to acquire
    its virtual assistant SIRI? The acquisition of the software cost somewhere around a whopping $200 million.
     Further, the high cost of AI implementation is evident from the fact that Amazon acquired 
 for $26 million in 2013.<h4>
 <h3>2. CAN’T REPLACE HUMANS<h3>
 <h4>It is beyond any doubt that machines perform much more efficiently as compared to a human being.
  But even then it is practically impossible to replace humans with AIs, at least in the near future,
   because you can’t build human intelligence in a machine as it is a gift of nature.
    So, no matter how smart a machine can become, it can never replace a human.<h4>
<h3>4. LACKS CREATIVITY<h3>
<h4>As already mentioned above – AIs are not built for creative pieces of work. So, it should be crystal clear by now that creativity or imagination is not the forte of the AIs. Although they can help you in designing and creating something special, they still can’t compete with the human brain. Their creativity is limited to the creative ability of the person who programs and commands them.

Human brains are characterized by immense sensitivity and high emotional quotient. To put it simply, 
AIs can become skilled machines but they can never acquire the abilities of the human brain. The reason is
 that skills can be learned and mastered, but abilities come naturally and can only be honed.<h4>
