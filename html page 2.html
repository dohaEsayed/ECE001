<h1>Advantages of artificial intelligence</h1>




<h2>What are the Advantages of artificial Intelligence?<h2>
<h3>1. Reduction in Human Error<h3>
<h4>One of the biggest advantages of AI is that it can significantly reduce errors and increase 
accuracy and precision. The decisions taken by AI in every step is decided by information previously 
gathered and a certain set of algorithms. When programmed properly, 
these errors can be reduced to null.<h4> 
<h3>2. Digital Assistance<h3>
<h4>Almost all the big organizations these days use digital assistants to interact with their customers which
 significantly minimizes the need for human resources. You can chat with a chatbot and ask them exactly what
  you need. Some chatbots have become so intelligent these
   days that you wouldnâ€™t be able to determine whether you are chatting with a chatbot or a
human being.<h4>

<h3>3. New Inventions<h3>
 <h4>AI has helped in coming up with new inventions in almost every domain to solve complex problems.
  A recent invention has helped doctors to predict early stages of breast cancer in women using advanced 
  AI-based technologies.<h4>

<h3>4. Unbiased Decisions<h3>
<h4>Human beings are driven by emotions, whether we like it or not. AI on the other hand, 
is devoid of emotions and highly practical and rational in its approach. A huge advantage of Artificial 
Intelligence is that it doesn't have any biased views, which ensures more accurate decision-making.<h4>
